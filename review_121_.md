# Review for COMP1101 formative asssessment
## Interest of content
The pages are (in general) engaging and well researched. The `communication`, `education` and `medicine` pages are interesting reads that cite their content where appropriate. The `agriculture` page, however is just comprised of 'lorem ipsum' filler text, which is obviously insufficient.

Final classification: Outstanding 
## Consistency and quality of visual presentation
The visual presentation was quite consistent, as they all included one central header with white text below and citations (where necessary) at the bottom, but the usage of headers (and their sizes) varied from page to page. In `communication` and `medicine` headers are used to good effect, `education` could have benefitted from this. As previously stated `agriculture` does not have any content at all.

The presentation is very appealing. The background images that change periodically manage to be interesting while not being distracting and darker text background layer helps contrast the white text, making for a nice reading experience. The expand-on-hover headers make for an nice visual effect, but were sometimes a little distracting. 

However, the link colour contrasts quite poorly with the darker background layer, making it difficult to read (especially with certain background images). The footer also remains in view while scrolling, meaning that it clashes with text in the foreground making it difficult to read the text that is in front of it.

Final classification: Very good
## Quality of written presentation
The written presentation is generally very good again. We could not find any grammatical mistakes in the text and the sentence structure was varied and engaging. The use of headers helped to segment the text into more easily readable sections and the contrast of the text (other than for links) cannot be faulted. 

Final classification: Exemplary
## Validity of HTML
The HTML is well formed with no errors and very few warnings. Other than the syntactic issueslike the usage of 9 `<br>` tags next to eachother or the poor indenting of the "testimonial-carousel" element (which is very nice by the way) everything else is completely fine.

Final classification: Outstanding
## Evidence of collaboration
 - [ ] **Author info not written by author**
	Though the definition of 'author info' is pretty vague, we couldn't find any on the website at all. Names were mentionned, but even that was only commited by `russianambassador`.
 - [x] **Balanced contributions from members**
	Though the certain members certainly committed more than others (`russianambassador` and `K4kap0`), all members seem to have contributed signifcantly to their pages and the website in general.	
 - [x] **Not completed at the last minute**
	The final commit was made on Nov 4, 2021 and most of the other commits were done before that. No faults here

Final classification: Excellent
